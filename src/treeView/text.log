If you found this file then probably you didn't write directory or if you did then you did it wrong.
Directory should be specified as "C:\\dir\\anotherDir" - note that dirs are separated with two backslashes \\
Types of files should be specified as:
    ".*.txt" - if you want to find all txt files (note that in Java regex for any quantity of any symbols is not just * but .*)
There is no any restrictions for strings to find
